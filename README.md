# Read Later Add-on

This add-on lets you save web articles for offline reading, keep a searchable library, and export articles to multiple formats.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- NVDA+Alt+D: Save current article (opens a Save Article dialog).
- NVDA+J: Open the saved articles library.

## Menu

NVDA menu > Tools > Read Later Add-on

- Open the article library
- Read saved articles
- Search and filter articles
- Export articles

## Notes

- Articles are stored locally in the NVDA user configuration folder under `readLater\articles` (for example:
  `%APPDATA%\nvda\readLater\articles`).
- If the URL cannot be detected automatically, you can paste or edit it in the Save Article dialog.
